# cmap2graph()


`cmap2graph(file, data_type, keyterms=None, read_from_file=True, encoding='utf-8', read_from=0, pfnet=False, max=None, min=None, r=np.inf)`
    
## Description    
Convert a concept map (or a proximity/adjacency matrix) into a NetworkX graph.

## Arguments
``file``: A list (see the data type below), or a file path of a .txt document. Theoretically, contents can be written in any language, as long as Python and your computer support it. If you try to open a file, then you might have to set a suitable encoding form, for example, if contents is written in Chinese, the .txt file better save as utf-8 encoding, and should be open as the same encoding too.

``data_type``: A string named "pair" or "array". For the data type "pair", "file" should be a list contained every propositions/edges/links/lines from a concept map, e.g., file = [['concept A', 'concept B'], ['concept A', 'concept C'], ...]. For the data type  "array", "file" should be a n*n proximity/adjacency matrix, n = number of key-terms, both row and column represent key-terms and value(i, j) represents the relationship of concept(i) and concept(j). Both rectangle and triangle matrix are acceptable. 

``keyterms``: A list contained some string variables, each string is one key-term. All key-terms should be written in lower case, but upper case is also acceptable, as long as value of the parameter "as_lower" have been set as False.

``read_from_file``: if True, then manipulate the "file" parameter as a string, if False, then manipulate the "file" parameter as a file path. 

``encoding``: default is "utf-8", which supports most languages, such as English, Chinese, Korean, Arabic, etc. 

``read_from``: From which row (line) to read when opening data from a file. Noted that the index of the first row (line) is 0.

``pfnet``: Whether the data should be converted into a undirected PFNet. The default vale is False.

``max``: A parameter used to convert the similarity matrix into the dissimilarity matrix if necessary. for example, if each value of the origin matrix ranges from 0 to 1, then "max" will be 1 and "min" will be 0.1. If values of both "max" and "min" are None (which is the default value), then the origin matrix will be used.

``min*``: See "max".

``r``: A parameter of pathfinder algorithm. Considering that the mental perception of concept relation is the ordinal scale, we set "r" as infinity, see "Schvaneveldt, R. W., Durso, F. T., & Dearhold, D. W. (1989). Network structures in proximity data. Psychology of Learning and Motivation, 24, 249-284".
    

## Value

A NetworkX graph represented the Knowledge Structure.

## Examples

```
import cookiemilk

# import from a list variable
my_cmap = [['A', 'B'], ['A', 'C'], ['A', 'D'], ['B', 'C']]
my_data = cookiemilk.cmap2graph(file=my_cmap, data_type='pair', read_from_file=False)
cookiemilk.draw(my_data)
```
